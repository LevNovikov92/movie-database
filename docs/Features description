### Movies list screen

This screen contains latest movies. Loading happens page by page, infinite scrolling is supported.
By default, the application will load all movies for all dates.
Pressing "All dates" view will open date selection dialog. It allows a user to filter movies by date. Since themoviedb API doesn't support requests with filter (i was not able to find), the application will make same requests and filter results on a client. So, more pages will be uploaded.

If the user will press on the item in the list, movie details screen will be opened.

The themoviedb API have the request limit (40 requests every 10 seconds) and will return 429 error when limit will be reached. [RequestLimitErrorInterceptor](https://github.com/LevNovikov92/movie-database/blob/master/core-network/src/main/java/com/levnovikov/core_network/interceptors/RequestLimitErrorInterceptor.kt) is handling that case by repeating the request with 3 seconds delay and blocking other requests. More details in RequestLimitErrorInterceptor.kt comments.

To keep filter data during activity recreation MoviesListState will be saved in the bundle and restored after recreation.

NOTE: Somehow themoviedb API sometimes return the same movie on two different pages (page 3 and 4 for instance). It looks like an API bug. Didn't have enough time for research.
